# Talari Jayakiran

Machine Learning & MLOps Engineer (in Progress)  
B.Tech AIML | Mohan Babu University

I am a Machine Learning–focused engineering student building end-to-end ML systems — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment as usable services.

My current focus is on Machine Learning and MLOps fundamentals, with equal emphasis on model correctness and system reliability. I prioritize reproducible workflows, deployment-first thinking, and clean project structures. Alongside this, I consistently strengthen my problem-solving foundation through DSA practice, ensuring strong algorithmic and system-level thinking.


## Core Focus Areas

- Classical Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling  
  (model selection, evaluation, interpretability, and performance trade-offs)

- End-to-End ML System Design  
  (data preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, deployment)

- MLOps Fundamentals  
  (reproducible workflows, API-based inference, deployment-first thinking)

- Prompting as a System Interface  
  (using structured prompts to interact with ML pipelines, control behavior, and support experimentation)

- Data-Centric ML  
  (data quality, feature relevance, and evaluation over model complexity)

- Algorithmic Thinking & DSA  
  (strong problem-solving foundations to support system-level reasoning)

## Project Philosophy

Each project is built with a consistent philosophy:

* fundamentals before complexity
* systems before models
* deployment and reliability as part of learning
* clear, reproducible project structure


## Engineering Toolchain

### Core Language
- **Python**  
  (primary language for data processing, modeling, and ML system development)

### Machine Learning
- **scikit-learn**  
  (classical ML models, pipelines, evaluation, baselines)
- **Modeling Focus:** correctness, interpretability, and reliability before complexity

### Data & Analysis
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
  (data preprocessing, feature engineering, transformations)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**  
  (analysis-driven visualization and model diagnostics)

### MLOps & System Design
- **End-to-End ML Pipelines**  
  (training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring)
- **Drift-aware workflows**  
  (detecting distribution changes and triggering retraining)
- **Reproducible project structures**  
  (clear separation of data, logic, and configuration)

### APIs & Deployment
- **FastAPI / REST APIs**  
  (model serving, live inference, system health checks)
- **Deployment-first mindset**  
  (models exposed as usable services, not static artifacts)

### Cloud & Infrastructure (Actively Exploring)
- **AWS**  
  (compute, deployment, and always-on ML services)
- **Focus:** reliability, availability, and system uptime over experimentation

### Version Control & Collaboration
- **Git, GitHub**  
  (clean repositories, commit discipline, project documentation)

### Prompting as a System Capability
- **Prompting integrated into ML workflows**  
  (used as an interface for controlling behavior, experimentation, and system interaction — not treated as a standalone skill)

## Problem Solving & Engineering Discipline

I maintain consistent problem-solving practice to strengthen the algorithmic foundations required for building reliable ML systems.

- **100+ days of consistent LeetCode practice**
- Solved problems across arrays, hashing, strings, recursion, trees, and core algorithms
- Focused on correctness, edge-case handling, and time–space trade-offs

Beyond interview preparation, this discipline directly improves how I:
- design and debug ML pipelines  
- reason about data transformations and feature logic  
- identify bottlenecks in training and inference workflows  
- build systems that behave predictably under edge cases  

Consistent DSA practice reinforces structured thinking, which is critical when ML systems move from experimentation to production.

- Gained exposure to end-to-end ML problem solving, including data preparation, model development, and evaluation  
- Strengthened understanding of how ML concepts translate into real project deliverables and team-based execution  

### Certifications (Selected)
- Completed multiple **applied Machine Learning and data-focused certifications** through recognized learning platforms  
- Certifications complement hands-on project work and reinforce fundamentals across:
  - data preprocessing and analysis  
  - classical ML modeling and evaluation

## Current Direction

I am currently focused on deepening **Machine Learning + MLOps robustness**, with emphasis on:

- monitoring model behavior in real-world conditions  
- handling data drift and retraining strategies  
- improving system reliability and availability  
- designing ML workflows that are maintainable over time  

My priority is not adding more models, but strengthening the **engineering quality** of ML systems so they remain correct, observable, and resilient in production environments.
